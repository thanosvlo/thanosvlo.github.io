# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I lead the ML Personalisation & Search function at Monzo, driving the development of intelligent, responsible systems that personalise product experiences across the app — from Loans and Flex to Savings, Investments, and beyond. I spearhead the design and deployment of ranking models, causal recommender systems, and experimentation frameworks, combining cutting-edge research with production-grade engineering. Alongside building the core systems, I shape Monzo’s broader AI/ML strategy — from governance and evaluation to capability building — ensuring we balance innovation with safety, impact, and scalability. I hold a PhD from Imperial College London and the Biomedical Image Analysis group.
